# POS API
This is an API for [icesum](https://github.com/cadia-lvl/POS) using the [ELG specification](https://european-language-grid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/all/A3_API/LTInternalAPI.html#basic-api-pattern).
The API is wrapped in a [docker container](https://www.docker.com/) and is implemented using [fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).

# Getting started
```bash
make build
make run
```

# API calls
All the API calls use post and input/outputs are in a json format.
Further details about the api calls are automatically generated when the container is run and can be found in /docs or /redoc
